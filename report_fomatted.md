# Protocol Summary

Protocol does X, Y, Z

# Disclaimer

The YOUR_NAME_HERE team makes all effort to find as many vulnerabilities in the code in the given time period, but holds no responsibilities for the findings provided in this document. A security audit by the team is not an endorsement of the underlying business or product. The audit was time-boxed and the review of the code was solely on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation of the contracts.

This project is to enter a raffle to win a cute dog NFT. The protocol should do the following:

1. Call the `enterRaffle` function with the following parameters:
   1. `address[] participants`: A list of addresses that enter. You can use this to enter yourself multiple times, or yourself and a group of your friends.
2. Duplicate addresses are not allowed
3. Users are allowed to get a refund of their ticket & `value` if they call the `refund` function
4. Every X seconds, the raffle will be able to draw a winner and be minted a random puppy
5. The owner of the protocol will set a feeAddress to take a cut of the `value`, and the rest of the funds will be sent to the winner of the puppy.


# Risk Classification

|            |        | Impact |        |     |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | --- |
|            |        | High   | Medium | Low |
|            | High   | H      | H/M    | M   |
| Likelihood | Medium | H/M    | M      | M/L |
|            | Low    | M      | M/L    | L   |

We use the [CodeHawks](https://docs.codehawks.com/hawks-auditors/how-to-evaluate-a-finding-severity) severity matrix to determine severity. See the documentation for more details.
